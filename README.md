#Solar Simulator
_made by Pooya Alizadeh_

Solar Simulator is simulator written in C++ with OpenGL and its job is to simulate what happens and how two objects mainly planets and stars intract with eachother.
Solar Simulator does not use any Game Engine and i've implemented my own renderer and model importer.
This Project is nearly 60% done.

##How to compile
you will need Cmake for compiling this for your platform.
once you have it, just run Build.bat (on windows) and it will generate a .sln file which you can open it with Visual Studio and build it there.
